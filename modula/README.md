# Modula Explorations

Since Modula first emerged in 1975, programming in this language is somewhat limited due to its age. The primary compiler available, [ADW Modula-2](https://www.modula2.org/adwm2/), is exclusively downloadable for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows systems.

## About Modula

The initial version of Modula was conceived by Niklaus Wirth in 1975 as an evolution of his earlier creation, the Pascal language. You can access original paper, [Modula: A Language for Modular Multiprogramming](https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/68669), written by Wirth.

Modula introduced an advancement in the form of its module system. This system is designed to group programs into independent modules.

Subsequently, Wirth created a second iteration of Modula known as Modula-2. This iteration introduced three main concepts: modules for separate compilation units, coroutines enabling program pause and resume functionalities, and enhanced type and procedure support.

## Modula Open Source Projects

While Modula was influential in the realm of programming languages that utilize a module structure, it's largely considered a historical language. 

Therefore, it's unlikely that you'll find many, if any, active open-source projects using Modula. However, you might encounter academic or historical projects that explore its concepts or implementations.
