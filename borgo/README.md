# Borgo Explorations:

To get started with Borgo on your local machine, begin by [installing Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html), the package manager for `Rust`.

Next, to compile your `.brg` files, open a terminal and run:

```
cargo run -- build
```

Once compiled, you can execute the generated `.go` files with:

```
go run .
```

You can also try Borgo on the [online playground](https://borgo-lang.github.io/) directly in your browser.

## About Borgo:

Borgo is a new programming language, created by Marco Sampellegrini, that compiles to Go. Itâ€™s designed to strike a balance between the simplicity of Go and the type safety of Rust, aiming to be "more expressive than Go but less complex than Rust." Borgo is actively evolving, with its initial commit appearing on GitHub on February 12th, 2023.
