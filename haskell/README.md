# Haskell Explorations

To build and run Haskell programs on your local machine, follow the instructions form the [Haskell downloads page](https://www.haskell.org/downloads/). The recommended path to follow is to fetch and run GHCup.

Once installed, programs in this folder can be run from the command line like so:

```
runhaskell triple.hs
```

```
runhaskell permutations.hs I like carrots
```

```
runhaskell top_ten_scorers.hs < ../test/wnba_input
```

Running the command `ghci` with no arguments gives you a repl.

To run the tests on a Unix-like shell:

```
./test.sh
```

## About Haskell

Haskell is a general-purpose, statically typed, purely functional programming language with type inference and lazy evaluation. It was created by a committee of researchers in 1990, and is named after the logician Haskell Curry. It is perhaps the most popular of the “pure“ functional languages, and is used in industry for a variety of purposes, including web development, data analysis, and machine learning.
