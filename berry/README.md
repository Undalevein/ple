# Berry Explorations

To build and run Berry programs on your local machine, download the zip file and build the compiler from the [Berry GitHub page](https://github.com/berry-lang/berry) or use your favorite package manager. Note that if you are building it, you will need to have make installed.

Programs in this folder can be run from the command line like so:

```
berry triple.be
```

```
berry permutations.be I like carrots
```

```
berry top_ten_scorers.be < ../test/wnba_input           # NOT TESTED YET
```

Running the command `berry` with no arguments gives you a repl.

To run the tests on a Unix-like shell:

```
./test.sh
```

Run `test.ps1` in PowerShell.
