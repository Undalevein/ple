# NASM Explorations:

To begin coding with NASM (Netwide Assembler), start by installing the [NASM assembler](https://www.nasm.us/), which provides a modern, open-source assembler for x86 and x86-64 architectures.

You can also explore NASM documentation and resources on the [NASM official website](https://www.nasm.us/doc/).

Once you have NASM installed, you can assemble and link your assembly code using the terminal or command prompt with ease.

## About NASM:

NASM is a portable, modular assembler for the x86 and x86-64 platforms that was originally developed in October 1996 by Simon Tatham. NASM's has simple yet powerful syntax that positions it as a popular choice for systems programming, reverse engineering, and learning assembly language. For this reason, NASM is considered one of the most popular assemblers for Linux and x86 chip development. NASM is also prided for its open-source development allowing for new improvements such as version 2.00 (released November 2007) which introduced x86-64 extensions.
