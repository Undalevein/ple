# Unison Explorations

To build and run Unison code, the current installation options are available for Mac OS X, 64-bit Linux, and Windows.

If [homebrew](https://brew.sh) is installed, you can run the following commands in your terminal:

```
brew tap unisonweb/unison
brew install unison-language
```

For a Windows installation:
```
Download UCM and extract it to a location of your choosing.
Run ucm.exe
```

After Unison is available on your machine, you can follow the steps [here](https://www.unison-lang.org/docs/quickstart/#step-3-create-the-quickstart-project) to create a Unison codebase and a quickstart project.

To run a program, use any text editor and create a file with the `.u` extension in the same directory where you launched `ucm`.

## About Unison

Unison is a functional and statically typed programming language, making its debut in 2019. Rooted in Paul Chiusano's research, it grew under the collaborative efforts of Arya Irani, Rúnar Bjarnason, and a supportive community of open-source programmers. The language is well-known for its modern approach to distributed programming, refactoring techniques, resilient storage mechanisms, storing code, and dependency management.

Of particular note is Unison's tribute to the conceptual foundations of Haskell, Erlang, and the experimental language Frank, which served as inspiration for its core principles. In addition, its type system draws from the paper, "Complete and Easy Bidirectional TypeChecking for Higher-Rank Polymorphism".
