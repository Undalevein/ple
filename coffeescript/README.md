# CoffeeScript Explorations:

To start coding with CoffeeScript, first make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) and [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/commands/npm-install) installed. Once that's set up, you can install CoffeeScript as follows:

```
# Install locally for a project:
npm install --save-dev coffeescript
```

```
# Install globally to execute .coffee files anywhere:
npm install --global coffeescript
```

After installation, you can compile CoffeeScript files from the command line with:

```
coffee -c filename.coffee
```

## About CoffeeScript:

CoffeeScript is a language that compiles into JavaScript, developed by Jeremy Ashkenas in 2009. Designed with "syntactic sugar" to enhance readability, CoffeeScript offers a cleaner syntax for JavaScript. The latest version, CoffeeScript 2, keeps up with modern JavaScript standards, and while it was widely used for both back-end and front-end development, its popularity has declined as JavaScript (and TypeScript) now offer many similar features. CoffeeScript remains an excellent tool for learning how languages can compile to JavaScript.
