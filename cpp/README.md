# CPP Examples

To get CPP:

If you don't have a text editor or IDE installed, you can use <a href="https://replit.com/">replit</a> to write and compile simple c++ programs

<details><summary><b>MacOS</b></summary>
  
Note: Mac automatically has Clang which can be used to compile CPP programs and files but for this I will show an example using gcc, or the gnu compiler collection: 
  
<br />In your terminal (Mac Terminal): <br />

  ```sh
    $ brew install gcc
  ```  
 </details>
<details><summary><b>Windows</b></summary>
  
<br />GCC is needed to compile c++ (cpp) programs: <br />
  First, install MinGW for Windows and follow the setup procedure. <a href="https://www.scaler.com/topics/c/c-compiler-for-windows/">Look here for more info.</a>

# About CPP

C plus plus is an OOP language that focuses on allowing users to reuse code, gives a clear structure to programs, and is not platform-specific. Primarily used for the creation of games and computer programs, the language was first released in 1985 by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup with the goal of extending the C programming language. However, due to its benefits in the areas of performance, effiency, and flexibility, it has become a staple in many areas of computer science, mostly in the sectors of systems programming, embedded systems, game creation, servers, and overall performance-critical applications.
