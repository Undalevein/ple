# APL Explorations

APL is not typically pre-installed on most systems. To start using APL, you need to install an APL interpreter or development environment. One of the most popular implementations is Dyalog APL, which you can download from the [Dyalog Download Page](https://www.dyalog.com/download-zone.htm). For open-source alternatives, consider [GNU APL](http://www.gnu.org/software/apl/) or [ngn/apl](https://github.com/ngn/apl), a JavaScript-based interpreter.

Once installed, you can run APL code using the provided interpreter or IDE. To experience APL without installation, try the online interpreter at [TryAPL](https://tryapl.org/).

For a basic usage example, visit this [APL Introduction](https://www.dyalog.com/dyalog/intro/) page.

## About APL

APL, named after the book "A Programming Language", is a symbolic programming language developed by Kenneth E. Iverson in the early 1960s. Renowned for its concise syntax, APL uses a unique set of non-ASCII symbols to represent complex operations, especially for array and matrix manipulations. This symbolic notation allows for powerful one-liners that can perform intricate computations efficiently. This efficiency is carried by the multidimensional array which stands as APL's central datatype.

Despite its age, APL remains influential and is still used in various industries, like finance and data analysis, due to its effectiveness in handling large datasets and mathematical computations.
