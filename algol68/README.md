For MacOS users, installation via Homebrew is straightforward. Simply type the following into the terminal:

```
brew install algol68g
``` 

To start writing code you can write from these [example programs](https://jmvdveer.home.xs4all.nl/en.browse.algol-68-genie-current.html).

## About Algol 68

Algol 68 made its debut in 1969 and underwent a significant revision in 1975 to enhance stability and functionality. The language was created by the IFIP Working Group 2.1, made up of notable computer scientists such as A. van Wijngaarden and B.J. Mailloux, among others. Notably, Niklaus Wirth was also a member of this group but parted ways due to ideological disagreements, later developing the Pascal language as a result.

According to the language’s revised report, Algol 68 was “designed to communicate algorithms, to execute them efficiently on a variety of different computers, and to aid in teaching them to students”. Primarily utilized in educational settings, Algol 68 gained traction in the UK, particularly on International Computers Limited (ICL) machines.
