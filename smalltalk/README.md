# Smalltalk Explorations:

To begin coding with Smalltalk, start by installing the [Pharo Smalltalk environment](https://pharo.org/), which provides a modern, open-source Smalltalk development environment.

You can also explore other Smalltalk implementations on the [Smalltalk Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk#List_of_implementations).

Once you have the environment installed, you can run Smalltalk code directly within the Pharo IDE (or other IDE if you chose another).

## About Smalltalk:

Smalltalk is an object-oriented, dynamically typed, reflective programming language created by Alan Kay and others at Xerox PARC in the 1970s. Smalltalk was one of the first languages to support a fully object-oriented paradigm, with everything in the language represented as objects. It allows for both structural and computational reflection with everything defined by Smalltalk-80 objects. The language's syntax focuses on readibility and simplicity, which later ended up influencing many modern languages.

## Smalltalk Resources:

Continue your study of Smalltalk via:

- [Pharo Smalltalk](https://pharo.org/)
- [Squeak Smalltalk](https://squeak.org/)
- [Smalltalk Documentation](https://www.gnu.org/software/smalltalk/manual/html_node/)
- [Smalltalk on Rosetta Code](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Smalltalk)

## Smalltalk Open Source Projects:

Studying and contributing to open-source projects is a great way to build proficiency in any programming language. The Pharo GitHub repository and other Smalltalk project repositories often include issues that are open for contribution:

- [Pharo GitHub Issues](https://github.com/pharo-project/pharo/issues)
- [Squeak GitHub Issues](https://github.com/OpenSmalltalk/opensmalltalk-vm/issues)
