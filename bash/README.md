# Bash Explorations

To build and run Bash programs on your local machine, follow the instructions in this [Bash Scripting guide](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bash-scripting-introduction-to-bash-and-bash-scripting/#how-to-write-bash-scripts)

Once installed, programs can be run from the command line like so:

```
chmod +x scriptname.sh
./scriptname.sh

## About Bash

Bash, short for "Bourne-Again SHell," was introduced in 1989, with its development initially led by Brian Fox and later continued by Chet Ramey. It serves as the GNU Projectâ€™s command-line shell and interpreter, providing users direct control over their systems via the terminal. 

Bash is favored by data scientists due to its efficiency in pre-processing large datasets. It also excels at automating tasks, making it more powerful than a graphical user interface (GUI) for many operations. Additionally, Bash's flexibility allows users to execute multiple programming languages within the same environment.
