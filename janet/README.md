# Janet Explorations

To build and run Janet programs on your local machine, download and install the most recent language version from the [Janet GitHub releases page](https://github.com/janet-lang/janet/releases) or use your favorite package manager.

Programs in this folder have been tested using Janet 1.37.1-local and can be run from the command line like so:

```
janet triple.janet
```

```
janet permutations.janet triple.janet
 I like carrots     #NOT TESTED YET
```

```
janet top_ten_scorers.janet triple.janet
 < ../test/wnba_input      #NOT TESTED YET
```

Running the command `janet` with no arguments gives you a repl.

To run the tests, invoke `./test.sh` in a Unix-friendly shell or `test.ps1` in PowerShell.
