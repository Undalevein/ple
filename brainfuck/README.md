# About Brainfuck

Brainfuck is a minimalist programming language that consists of only eight commands. Created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller, this language only operates using 8 commands: ["<", ">", "+", "-", "[", "]", ",", "."]. The language operates on a memory tape with cells that can hold one byte of data. It is important to note that this tape is infinite in both directions, meaning it can be moved left or right. Although it might not look like it, it is turing complete meaning any program written in a language like C or Java can be written in Brainfuck. However, due to its basic and esoteric style, complex programs can become quite challenging.
