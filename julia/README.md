# Julia Examples

To get Julia:
<details><summary><b>Download</b></summary>
  
  First, go to <a href="https://julialang.org/downloads/">this website</a> and download the correct download for your OS. Once downloaded, run the installer. Then, you should get an official Julia bin file in the bin dir where Julia was installed. This will give you a repl inside of terminal that can run and evaluate code. Otherwise, you can use an IDE or textual interface to code and run Julia.

<details><summary><b>Online</b></summary>
  
  To practice with Julia online, I would recommend using <a href="https://replit.com/">Replit</a>. You can write and compile most simple programs. If you plan to go beyond one file code, I would recommend installing Julia for ease and consistency in your own dev environment.

# About Julia

Julia is a high-level, dynamic programming language designed for scientific and numerical computing. Combining the ease-of-use of interpreted languages like Python with the speed and performance of compiled languages like C++, Julia uses just-in-time (JIT) compilation to achieve high performance, making it suitable for computationally intensive tasks which makes it desireable for many situations. Furthermore, julia has a strong type system that allows for multiple dispatch, meaning that functions can be defined with different behavior depending on the types of arguments they are called with. To summarize, Julia has the benefits of dominating languages such as python's ease of use and C++'s fast compilation which makes it a powerful language for a variety of purposes.

# Julia Open Source Projects

Studying, and contributing to, open source projects is an excellent way to improve your proficiency in any language. Due to its capabilities, there is no possible way to contain all the Julia open-source projects but a few will be provided here:
- [Julia itself is Open-Source](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia)
- [Modeling Toolkit](https://github.com/SciML/ModelingToolkit.jl)
- [JuMP](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl)
