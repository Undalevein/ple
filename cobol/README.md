# Cobol Explorations:

To program and run COBOL code, there are a couple of good options. One option is using [Tutorialspoint’s](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cobol/cobol_environment_setup.htm) free online COBOL compiler. 

Alternatively, you can install the [Open COBOL IDE](https://pypi.org/project/OpenCobolIDE/) to write and run programs on your own machine.

## About Cobol:

COBOL, which stands for Common Business Oriented Language, was created back in 1959 by a group called CODASYL. It was designed specifically for business applications, especially in areas like finance and defense, and it is effective at handling large amounts of data due to its advanced file handling features. 

Today, 90% of Fortune 500 companies—especially in finance, insurance, airlines, and retail—still rely on COBOL. While many big financial institutions were still building new systems in COBOL as late as 2006, most of the programming work done with COBOL today is focused on keeping existing applications running smoothly.
