# D (Dlang)
- **Creator**: Walter Bright at Digital Mars <br/>
- **Released**: 2001<br/>
- **Unique features**:
  - Static typing with C-like syntax (inspired by CPP and ALGOL style languages)
  - Draws from CPP originally but expanded to include features from other languages such as Java, Ruby, Python, C#, and Eiffel
  - Combines aspects from modern dynamic and functional languages
    - Dynamic
      - No need for re-typing types
      - Uses static inference to deduce types
      - Automatic Memory Management
      - Linear arrays and Maps with Pythonic slicing capabilities
    - Functional
      - Closures
      - Function Literals
      - Map, Filter, Reduce
  - It also uses aspects of the concurrent, object-oriented, imperative, and metaprogramming paradigms
  - Offers aspects of OOP such as polymorphism, generics, inheritance, interfaces, overloading, modules, nested classes
  - Security features such as true immutability for data and controlled mutability across threads
  - Similar to Python allows for function decorators (@safe, @trusted, and @system) that allow for specific security protocols and overall greater control
  - Allows for everything from low-level data abstraction to Haskell-style abstractions
- **Notes**:
  - Originally was a re-engineered version of CPP
  - Implemented many notable features before CPP did
  - Utilizes CPP/C backends to ensure fast code compilation and execution (as fast as CPP with generally less code)
  - Some people believe that D was created with the focus of forcing the C++ developers to implement specific new features into their language and used D as a conduit to fuel that
