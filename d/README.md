# DLang Explorations:

To start coding with the D programming language, visit the [DLang download page](https://dlang.org/download.html) and select the compiler that is compatible with your system. Once your compiler is installed, you can compile and run D programs. For example, to run a simple program saved as `hello.d`:

```
dmd hello.d
./hello
```

## About DLang:

D, also known as DLang, is a high-performance programming language initially developed by Walter Bright at Digital Mars, with its first release in 2001. It was designed to address some of the limitations of C++ while retaining the efficiency and control that systems-level programming demands. Over the years, D has evolved into a distinct language with its own features and strengths, emphasizing both performance and readability.

Dâ€™s efficient performance makes it ideal for a range of demanding applications, including system programming, game development, scientific computing, and real-time applications. It combines low-level control typical of C++ with high-level features like garbage collection, dynamic arrays, and an expressive syntax, making it versatile for both beginner-friendly and advanced projects.
