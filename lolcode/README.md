# LOLCODE Explorations:

There are several options for interpreters and compilers for LOLCODE. One such popular option is the [LOLCODE Interpreter on GitHub](https://github.com/justinmeza/lci). This interpreter has been written in C which makes it especially fast for exercuting LOLCODE scripts.

You can also explore the language details and syntax on the [LOLCODE website](http://www.lolcode.org/).

Once you have a LOLCODE interpreter or compiler set up, you can run `.lol` scripts using the intepreter:

`lci ${filename}.lol`

## About LOLCODE:

LOLCODE is an esoteric programming language inspired by the language of the "LOLCATS" meme. Itâ€™s easily recognized by its humorous, distinctive syntax and playful approach to coding. Since its introduction around 2007, LOLCODE has maintained a small but enthusiastic community, continually iterating on the existing codebase.
