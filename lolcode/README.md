# LOLCODE Explorations

There are several options for interpreters and compilers for LOLCODE. One such popular option is the [LOLCODE Interpreter on GitHub](https://github.com/justinmeza/lci). This interpreter has been written in C which makes it especially fast for executing LOLCODE scripts. You may be able to obtain the interpreter from your system’s package manager. For MacOS, `brew install lolcode` will work.

Once installed, programs in this folder can be run from the command line like so:

```
lci triple.lol
```

## About LOLCODE

LOLCODE is an esoteric programming language inspired by the language of the "LOLCATS" meme. It’s easily recognized by its humorous, distinctive syntax and playful approach to coding. Since its introduction around 2007, LOLCODE has maintained a small but enthusiastic community, continually iterating on the existing codebase.
