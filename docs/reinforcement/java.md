# Java Reinforcement Practice

Here are a set of problems designed to help you reinforce and retain some useful Java knowledge. If you are an [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) fan, consider adding some of these questions into a deck. üòÄ

1. Who created Java and in what year?

1. Java programs are made up entirely of ________________ grouped into ________________.

1. Suppose _Hello.java_ contained a program intended to be run from the command line. How do you compile and run the program from a typical operating system terminal application?

1. Python, Swift, and Haskell require explcit `import` directives to use entities from a different module (or package). Does Java require one as well? Why or why not?

1. What is the difference between `InputStream` and `OutputStream` on the one hand and `Reader` and `Writer` on the other?

1. Are `InputStream` and `OutputStream` actually stream objects, as defined in the package `java.util.Stream`?

1. Is `flatMap` a method of arrays? What about `filter`? What about `map`?

1. What is the difference between a variable and an object in Java?

1. Variables have _________________ and objects have ________________.

1. What kind of names can Java infer the types of?

1. Java‚Äôs REPL is called ________________.

1. What are the eight primitive types?

1. What is the difference between a primitive and a reference type?

1. What is the difference between an interface and a class?

1. Can an interface have methods with a body? Why or why not? If so, what is such a method known as and how even does it work?

1. How do you write the JavaScript array literal `[13, 5, 8, 2]` in Java?

1. Is `null` a member of every reference type in Java? If so, what were the designers of the language thinking when they included this ‚Äúfeature‚Äù?

1. What is the inclusion of `null` as a member of every reference type referred to? Who called it that? Why?

1. In Java, is `List` a type? Is `List<Integer>` a type?

1. What is the difference between `List<Object>` and `List<?>`?

1. Suppose `Animal` is a superclass of `Dog`. In Java, is `List<Dog>` a subclass of `List<Animal>`?

1. What is the equivalent of Swift‚Äôs `nil` in Java?

1. What is the equivalent of Swift‚Äôs `x ?. y` in Java?

1. What is the equivalent of Swift‚Äôs `x ?? y` in Java?

1. Suppose that `o` is an optional that wraps an integer, and `f` is a function that takes in an integer. How do you safely invoke `f` on the wrapped integer, given that `o` might be empty?

1. Java lambda functions impelement interfaces annotated with which annotation?

1. What is the characteristic method of a Java supplier? Of a consumer? Of a predicate?

1. How do you create a stream producing the integers 1 through 100?

1. How do you create an infinite stream of the even numbers starting at 20?

1. How do you create an empty stream?

1. How do you create a stream of 100 zeros followed by 1000000 ones? (Note: the entire stream is to have exactly those 1000100 elements. The stream should, as streams do, generate elements on demand.)

1. How do you create a stream from an array?

1. Given an array `a`, what does `Arrays.stream(a).distinct().toArray()` do?

1. For array `a`, what does `Arrays.stream(a).min()` return, exactly?

1. Suppose `r` was a `Reader` object. How do you get the lines of the reader into an array?

1. Suppose `r` was a `Reader` object. How do you get the lowercased lines of the reader into an array?

1. Suppose `r` was a `Reader` object. How do you get the lowercased lines of the reader into an array, sorted by line?

1. Suppose `r` was a `Reader` object. How do you get the lowercased lines of the reader into an array, eliminating all duplicates?
