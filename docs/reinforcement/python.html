<h1>Python Reinforcement Practice</h1>

<p>Here are a set of problems designed to help you <a href="https://ncase.me/remember/">reinforce and retain</a> some useful Python knowledge. If you are an <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> or Quizlet fan, consider adding some of these questions into a deck. üòÄ</p><hr>

<details><summary>Who created Python and in what year?</summary>Guido van Rossum, who started work on the language in 1989 but first released it to the world in 1991</details>

<details><summary>How long was GvR‚Äôs tenure as the BDFL?</summary>From the language‚Äôs inception to July, 2018</details>

<details><summary>How do you write a line of text to standard output?</summary><pre>
print(<i>sometext</i>)
</pre></details>

<details><summary>How do you access the third command line argument of a script, run on the command line?</summary><code>sys.argv[3]</code></details>

for line in sys.stdin:
    ...
</pre></details>

<details><summary>Why do we not have to worry about the expression <code>range(1, 10000000)</code> taking up a lot of memory?</summary>A range object is not a fully-realized sequence; it is a small thing that produces objects only on demand</details>

<details><summary>Why does Python not have primitive and reference types?</summary>The distinction is not necessary; the language philosophy values simplicity</details>

<details><summary>If everything in Python is an object, does that mean even integers and booleans get allocated on the heap? What allows them to not have to be heap-allocated?</summary>Because they are immutable, there is no difference between allocating on the heap (i.e., accessing them through references) and just allocating their values directly</details>

<details><summary>Does Python have distinct types for integers and floating point numbers?</summary>Yes, <code>int</code> and <code>float</code></details>
