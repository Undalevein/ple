# Haskell Reinforcement Practice

Here are a set of problems designed to help you reinforce and retain some useful Haskell knowledge. If you are an [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) fan, consider adding some of these questions into a deck. üòÄ

1. Who created Haskell and in what year?

1. Is Haskell statically or dynamically typed? Strongly or weakly typed? Manifest or inferential?

1. Haskell is statically typed. What does that mean?

1. Haskell is a lazy language. What does that mean?

1. Haskell functions are pure. What are pure functions?

1. What does Haskell use instead of curly braces for structure?

1. What is the most popular Haskell REPL called?

1. How do you write a ‚ÄúHello world‚Äù Haskell program as a script to be run on the command line?

1. Why is the Haskell ‚ÄúHello world‚Äù program not simply `putStrLn("Hello, world")`?

1. Assuming the file _hello.hs_ contained a command line Haskell program, how do you compile and run the program using `ghc`?

1. To compute the minium value of 3 and 5 we write `min 3 5`. Can we write `min 3 5 8`? Why or why not?

1. To compute the minium value of 3 and 5 we write `min 3 5`. Can we write `min 3`? What does this expression mean?

1. Haskell type inference is far more extensive than that of Java, Go, Rust, or Swift. What kinds of expressions can Haskell infer types for that these other languages cannot?

1. Haskell is supposedly a pure functional language but real programs need effects, random numbers, and I/O. How does Haskell do these things, if at all?

1. Give five advantages of pure functions.

1. Haskell does not provide for mutable data structures. Instead, Haskell datatypes employ _________________ data structures.

1. What does the function `succ` do? What is its type signature? (Hint: you‚Äôll have to know something about typeclasses here.)

1. Rewrite the expression `f(f(g(h(g(x)y))z))` using `$` only.

1. Rewrite the definition `f x = g(h(g(x)))` in point-free form.

1. Why _couldn‚Äôt_ Haskell‚Äôs designers bring themselves to use `+` for list concatentation, even if they wanted to?

1. Given the list `a = [10, 20, 30, 40]`, what are `head a`, `tail a`, `last a`, and `init a`?

1. Is Haskell list equality more like Python or JavaScript? How so?

1. Why do we never use the term *assignment* in Haskell? What do we use instead?

1. What is the ‚Äúnot-equals‚Äù operator in Haskell?

1. Define the Haskell function that accepts a number and returns the value of 10 plus that number. Include a type signature in your definition.

1. Give the Haskell function that accepts a number and returns the value of 10 plus that number, as a function expression.

1. How is the expression `sort   a++b` interpreted?

1. Haskell‚Äòs precedence relationship between infix operators and prefix operators is very simple. What is it?

1. How is the multipication operator used in prefix position? Give the expression that multiplies `x` and `y` using this prefix form.

1. Given the definition `doubledThenPlus x y = 2 * x + y`, give the expression that applies `doubledThenPlus` to `a` and `b` in infix form.

1. What are the six basic types?

1. What is the difference between `Int` and `Integer`?

1.
