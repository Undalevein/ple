# Swift Reinforcement Practice

Here are a set of problems designed to help you reinforce and retain some useful Swift knowledge. If you are an [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) fan, consider adding some of these questions into a deck. ðŸ˜€

1. Who created Swift and in what year?

1. Swift was designed to replace what language?

1. The three main goals for Swift was that it be safe, fast, and _________.

1. Does Swift use curly braces or indentation for structure?

1. What is the difference between the range operators `...` and `..<`?

1. What is the syntax for string interploation?

1. Parameters in Swift have two names. One of the names is called the local name. What is the other name called?

1. How do you mark that a parameter can be changed?

1. How do you mark the argument passed to an `inout` parameter?

1. Many languages use `split` to break a string into a list of characters, and `join` to turn an array of characters into a string. How do you do these two operations in Swift?

1. Mutable variables are introduced with ________ and immutable variables with ________.

1. We use the `print` function to write to standard output. But how do we write to standard error?

1. How are the command line arguments obtained?

1. It is legal to write `var x = 1` but not legal to write `var a = []`. Why?

1. When reading a line from a file in Python, an exception is raised when the file has been fully read. What happens in Swift? What is the return type of `readLine`?

1. How do you access the second element of the tuple t?

1. List all the integer types of Swift.

1. Are the built-in types `Float` and `Double` guaranteed to have a fixed implementation size, or are they implementation-dependent as in C++? If they do, what are these sizes?

1. What are the six type kinds?

1. How do structs and classes differ?

1. What is the nicer way of writing the type expressions `Array<Int>` and `Dictionary<String, Bool>`?

1. Are arrays, sets, and dictionaries structs or classes?

1. Do the equality operators `==` and `!=` for arrays, sets, and dictionaries compare the elements of these objects or is the comparison done on object identities?

1. What is the method for getting the number of array elements, the number of set elements, and the number of dictionary entries?

1. How do you determine if a value is contained in a given array?

1. How does the read-onliness of an array, set, or dictionary in Swift differ from the const-ness of an object in JavaScript?

1. How do you arrange for a function call to _not_ require the external name of a parameter?

1. For a function definition using `func`, are you allowed to omit the types of the parameters? Are you allowed to omit the return type?

1. What is a **closure** in Swift?

1. Write a closure that squares its argument with both the in-notation and the form with the shorthand argument names.
