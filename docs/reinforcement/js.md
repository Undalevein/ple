# JavaScript Reinforcement Practice

This problem set covers not only programming in JavaScript, but concepts about JavaScript. Don‚Äôt worry. It will not be graded. Work on it at your own pace. It is provided to you to help with your retention of course material.

If you are an [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) fan, consider adding some of these questions into a deck. üòÄ

1. Who created JavaScript and in what year?

1. What was JavaScript originally called?

1. Why was JavaScript created?

1. How do you write a line of text to the console?

1. How do you change the text of an element in a web browser document?

1. How do you access the third command line argument of a script, run on the command line, with node.js?

1. Name the 7 data types of JavaScript (as of ES2019). Name the 8th that is coming soon.

1. Does JavaScript have separate types for integers and floating point values? If not, how can you tell whether a number is an integer or not?

1. What are safe integers in JavaScript?

1. How can you tell whether string `s` is a substring of string `t`?

1. What two things can you do with backtick-delimited strings you can‚Äôt do with strings delimited with apostrophes or quotation marks?

1. Give an example that shows the `==` operator is not transitive.

1. Why is `2 && 3` equal to 3, but `2 & 3` equal to 2?

1. Name all the falsy values in JavaScript.

1. When should you use `let` and when should you use `const`?

1. What bad thing will happen if you forget to use `let`, `const`, or `var` when declaring an identifier?

1. What is the object literal `{ x, y }` a shorthand for?

1. What is the difference between `p.x` and `p[x]`?

1. If `x === 'y'` then what is `{ x: 3, [x]: 5 }` ?

1. How do you write an object to the console (beautifully formatted)?

1. Describe how a prototype-based language (like JavaScript) differs from a class-based language (like Java), in terms of thinking about collections of objects that share the same structure and behavior.

1. What do we mean when we say arrays are objects in JavaScript?

1. Describe how `splice` works. Describe it to a friend on a whiteboard, or paper, with examples.

1. What is the spread operator? Give an example of its use.

1. You might often see the expression `a.slice()`, for some array `a`. What does this expression do, exactly?

1. How does one best create an array of size 100 in which every element is 0? (Do not write a loop.)

1. Write `a.concat(b)`, where `a` and `b` are arrays, using spreads.

1. `a.push()` mutates `a`. How do you do a non-mutating push?

1. What does `unshift` do? Does it mutate or not? What does it return?

1. What is the difference between value types and reference types?

1. Why do you think the JavaScript designer decided that objects should be reference types?

1. Since strings can be very large, you might think strings would be reference types in JavaScript. After all, they are reference types in Java. But in JavaScript, they are considered primitive (value) types. This might lead you to believe JavaScript is necessarily slow because strings are always copied on assignment. However, this is not the case! Why?

1. Write an IIFE that applies the (anonymous, arrow) function that squares its argument to the value 100.

1. In the function definition `function f(x, y) { return [x, y]; }`, what do we call `x` and `y`?

1. In the function call `f(y, z)`, what do we call `y` and `z`?

1. A function is called higher-order if it does at least one of two things. What two things?

1. What do the array methods `map`, `filter`, `every`, `some`, `find`, and `findIndex` do?

1. Write the function `function f(x = 3) { return x * y }` (where y is some global variable) without using a default parameter.

1. What is a rest parameter? Give an example.

1. Can a function definition have multiple rest parameters? Why or why not?

1. One could argue that all non-default parameters are really default parameters. Why?

1. In many languages, assignment has the form IDENTIFIER = EXPRESSION. In JavaScript, the left hand side is not just an identifier. What exactly is the left hand side called?

1. The old-fashioned to write a function that takes in an array and returns the sum of its first and third elements is: `function f(a) {return a[0] + a[2];}` Rewrite this in a modern fashion, where the function parameter is a pattern.

1. Write a function that takes in an object and returns the product of its x and y properties. If no argument is passed in, return 1. Write the function using a pattern for its parameter. Supply defaults so the function body is simply return `x * y`.

1. What are global scope, function scope, and block scope?

1. How do let-bound and var-bound function-scope variables differ? (Make sure the phrase ‚Äútemporal dead zone‚Äù appears in your answer.)

1. Write a function that takes in a number and returns a function that adds that number to its argument. Is the function you wrote higher-order? Why or why not? Does that function illustrate a closure? Why or why not? Does that function illustrate currying? Why or why not?

1. What is currying good for, anyway?

1. Given `function* f() {yield 1; yield 2; yield 3;}`, what is wrong with writing `for (let i of f) {console.log(i)}`? 

1. Why must (pretty much all reasonable) _methods_ be non-arrow functions?

1. Why should callbacks generally be arrow functions?

1. What does the expression `this` refer to inside of a function called with the `new` operator?

1. For function f and object x, the expressions `f.call(x, 1, 2)` and `f.apply(x, [1, 2])` produce the same result. Write the equivalent expression using `bind`.

1. JavaScript doesn‚Äôt have classes, but it does have the word `class`. But the keyword `class` declares a function. How is this function defined? Give a short example.

1. Why doesn‚Äôt Crockford like using `this`?

1. What is the primary disadvantage of the Crockford-classless style of avoiding `this` and prototypes?

1. How do you make a JavaScript object without a prototype?

1. What is **callback hell**?

1. What is an advantage of promises over callbacks?

1. What exactly _is_ a promise?

1. What does the function `async function five() { return 5; }` actually return?

1. Why do most API invocations, or operating system calls (like reading and writing files) take in callbacks or return promises?

1. What is the difference between an accessor property and a data property?

1. How do you make a property read-only?

1. What is the difference between sealing and freezing an object?
