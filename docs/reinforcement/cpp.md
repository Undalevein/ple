# C++ Reinforcement Practice

Here are a set of problems designed to help you reinforce and retain some useful C++ knowledge. If you are an [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) fan, consider adding some of these questions into a deck. üòÄ

1. Who created C++ and in what year?

1. C++ was intended to be a proper superset of what language?

1. What does it mean that C++ is a _systems language_?

1. What does it mean that C++ is an _unmanaged language_?

1. Unlike almost every other language with sophisticated modules that are imported, C++ wires together multifile programs with the weak `#include` directive. What exactly does `#include` do?

1. How do you write a string to standard output?

1. What does `using namespace` do and why is it so common in C++?

1. Show how to compile and run `hello.cpp` from the command line, using the `g++` compiler, using the 2017 standard version of the language.

1. C++17 has six different [built-in character types](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/types). What are they? There is one new character type added in C++20. What is it?

1. Integers can be signed or ________________. They can be short, regular-sized, or ________________.

1. In addition to `float` and `double`, C++ has one other floating-point type. What is it?

1. You might see `int&` used where a type should appear (say, in a variable or parameter declaration). One can argue this is not a type at all! What does this expression mean, and why do we say it is not a real type?

1. Is `void` a type? If not, what is it?

1. Give three different syntaxes to declare an immutable integer variable named `dozen` initialized to the value 12.

1. What are the types of the expressions `'$'`, `u'$'`, and `U'$'`?

1. Do the types `int`, `float`, and `double` have fixed bit sizes? If so, what are they? If not, why not?

1. Given `struct Point {int x; int y};` how do you declare a variable `p` of type `Point` whose `x` and `y` fields are initialized to 5 and 8, respectively?

1. Do structs have value semantics or reference semantics? What about classes?

1. Suppose `S` is a struct type whose instances are very large. How do you define a parameter of type `S` for a function in which the `S` object will not be changed?

1. Since structs are copied when passed as parameters, how can you write a function that mutates a struct?

1. C++ references, defined using `&` are really just aliases and nothing more. True or false?

1. If we define both `void f(int& x) {}` and `void f(int&& x) {}` when would the first function be called and when would the second?

1. Can the function `int f() {int x=2; int& y = x; return y;}` cause a dangling pointer when called? Why or why not?

1. Can the function `int* f() {int x=2; int* y = &x; return y;}` cause a dangling pointer when called? Why or why not?

1. Given `struct Point {int x; int y;}` is it legal to define and initialize a variable like this: `Point p = new Point {1,2}`? Why or why not?

1. What things go in static storage? Stack storage? Heap storage?

1. Every `new` must be matched with a what?

1. What is the keyword for the expression meaning a ‚Äúpointer that doesn‚Äôt point to anything‚Äù?

1. What do you have when you allocate a pointer with `new` but forget to deallocate it?

1. What do you have when a pointer has been deallocated but you try to dereference it?

1. If we define `void inc(int* x) {(*x)++;}`, and we wanted to use this function to increment a global variable `y`, how would we call the function?

1. It‚Äôs possible, but unusual, to write `(*p).x`. What do we write instead?

1. What is the expression for ‚Äúa pointer to x‚Äù?

1. Explain what type `x` is given in the declarator `char ***x[13][21]`.

1. Explain what type `c` is given in the declarator `int (*c)(long, long)`.

1. What is the difference between an instance method and a class method?

1. Python uses the `@classmethod` decorator to mark a class method. How do you mark a class method in C++?

1. Why are constructors not considered to be methods?

1. If you don‚Äôt write a constructor for a struct, can you still create an instance of the struct type and supply initial values to its fields? If so, how does this work?

1. If you write a constructor for a struct type `S`that takes in a single argument, and no other constructor, can you define a variable like so: `S s;`. Why or why not? Can you define `S* p`? Why or why not?

1. Why would you never see the expression `this.x` in C++?

1. If you had an instance `x` of a struct type `S`, and no constructors were explicity defined for `S`, what does `S y(x);` do? Use the terms ‚Äúconstruct,‚Äù ‚Äúcopy,‚Äù and ‚Äúshallow‚Äù in your answer.

1. If you had two instances `x` and `y` of a struct type `S`, and no methods were explicity defined for `S`, what does `x == y;` do? What, technically speaking, is invoked here?

1. Suppose you were writing your very own `Set` class, for mathematical sets. Show how to declare (just declare, do not define) operators for intersection (use `&`), union (use `|`) and complement (use `~`).

1. We know that `cout` is an instance of the class `ostream`. How did the creator of the `ostream` class get expressions like `cout << x` to work?

1. What are the three explicit access control modifiers for structs (and classes)?

1. What is the only difference between structs and classes in C++?

1. Although the difference between structs and classes is incredibly trivial,
