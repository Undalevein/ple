# C++ Reinforcement Practice

Here are a set of problems designed to help you reinforce and retain some useful C++ knowledge. If you are an [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) fan, consider adding some of these questions into a deck. ðŸ˜€

1. Who created C++ and in what year?

1. C++ was intended to be a proper superset of what language?

1. What does it mean that C++ is a _systems language_?

1. What does it mean that C++ is an _unmanaged language_?

1. Unlike almost every other language with sophisticated modules that are imported, C++ wires together multifile programs with the weak `#include` directive. What exactly does `#include` do?

1. How do you write a string to standard output?

1. What does `using namespace` do and why is it so common in C++?

1. C++ has six different built-in character types. What are they?

1. Integers can be signed or ________________. They can be short, regular-sized, or ________________.

1. In addition to `float` and `double`, C++ has two other floating-point types. What are they?

1. You might see `int&` used where a type should appear (say in a variable or parameter declaration). One can argue this is not a type at all! What does this expression mean, and why do we say it is not a real type?

1. Give three different syntaxes to declare an immutable integer variable named `dozen` initialized to the value 12.

1. What are the types of the expressions `'$'`, `u'$'`, and `U'$'`?

1. Do the types `int`, `float`, and `double` have fixed bit sizes? If so, what are they? If not, why not?
