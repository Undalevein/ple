# Reinforcement Problems

Here are set of problems designed to help you reinforce (commit to memory) many programming language facts that are an important part of working knowledge.

Each of the problems have been designed so they can be placed on a flash card, or entered into a system like [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).

Most are the answers are covered in the [book](https://rtoal.github.io/ple/) or my [course notes](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/classes/pl/), but some require a tiny amount of research.

Enjoy!
