# George Explorations

This language is quite antique and, as such, does not have a dedicated, sponsored compiler or repl. That being said, there is a straightforward tutorial to implement a interpreter created by `georgjz` hosted on <a href="https://georgjz.github.io/george-01/">GitHub</a>

## About George

George is a pioneering programming language first developed by Charles Leonard Hamblin in 1957 and showcased in his paper <a href="https://www.massey.ac.nz/~rmclachl/DPACM/121%20-%20addressless%20coding%20scheme.pdf">"An Addressless Coding Scheme Based on Mathematical Notation"</a>. This language pioneered the novel method of stack-based operations through one of the first uses of Reverse Polish Notation, wherein mathematical expressions are executed through a stack-based operations. For example, the expression `3 * 2` is written `3 2 *`. The language, although novel, did inspire multiple innovations in programming langauges and its influence can still be seen in modern, high-level languages.

## George Open Source Projects

Studying, and contributing to, open source projects is an excellent way to improve your proficiency in any language. However, George is a primitive and novel langauge from the 1950s and, as such, there are not many GitHub repos that utilize the language.
