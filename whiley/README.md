# Whiley Explorations

You have a couple options to explore Whiley:

<details><summary><b>Install the Whiley Compiler</b></summary>

To install Whiley, you will need to already have installed Java before installing. In addition, you may also need to have Cargo (from Rust) installed as well to install Whiley.

After getting both of these dependencies stated, type in the following command:

```
cargo install whiley
```

Afterwards, you can start running scripts. Though a bit cumbersome, to run an example code, copy the code from the scripts folder and paste it into `main.whiley`. Another way is to duplicate one of the files from scripts folder to the src folder and then rename it to `main.whiley` (if you run into issues, delete the existing file first). Then finally, at the root folder (`ple/whiley`), perform the following commands:

```
wy build
wy run
```
