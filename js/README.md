# JavaScript Examples

To get JavaScript for writing command line scripts and servers, download and install Node.js from the [Node home page](https://nodejs.org)

To run the tests on a Unix-like shell:

```
./test.sh
```

Note that this folder contains the file **package.json** to enable each of the command line **.js** files to run as module scripts, rather than classic scripts. Modules are the preferred way to write JavaScript, as they enable a host of newer modern features and are much more safe and secure. For the differences between scripts and modules, see [this article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) from MDNâ€™s JavaScript Guide.
