# Hylo Examples

Due to the early nature of the Hylo, there is not a version that can be used. However, an alpha version is expected to be released in the first half of 2023.

# About Hylo

Founded by Dimi Racordon, the language Hylo, formerly Val, was created around the ideas of mutable value semantics and generic programming. The goal being to become a better alternative to <a href="https://github.com/rtoal/ple/tree/main/cpp">C++</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rtoal/ple/tree/main/rust">Rust</a>. It was conceptualized in the early 2010s and is still being worked on today. There is a roadmap available on their website to check out their progress and goals. The alpha version of Hylo is hoped to be released in the first half of 2023, for developers to play around with. However, the open source language is available on GitHub and is welcoming contributors.
