# Mesa Explorations

Mesa is a rather obsolete language. Originally designed for the Xerox worksystems, this language cannot be run on any system natively due to its intertwined nature with the Xerox operating systems. As such, the langauge is more of a case study for understanding design choices of modern languages, specifically Java. One way to potentially run Xerox Mesa code is to use the Mesa emulator, which is a software that emulates the Xerox operating system and allows for the execution of Mesa code. One such emulator is called [ContrAlto](https://github.com/livingcomputermuseum/ContrAlto) but is an in-progress emulator so functionality might not be complete.

## About Mesa

Mesa was created by the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center in Palo Alto, California in the 1970s as an ALGOL-like language with strong support of modular programming. It is one of the most influential language, being the first programming language to implement a static analyzer separate from the compiler, a feature that has since become a standard in modern programming languages. Furthermore, Mesa was able to implement several aspects that are used heavily today, such as handling of software exceptions, thread synchronization, and incremental compilation. As such, the language is heralded as a influential programming language that has shaped the development of modern programming languages. It was heavily used on the Xerox Star workspaces and allowed Xerox to innovate on programming standards.

## Mesa Open Source Projects

There are no open source projects for Mesa as the language is obsolete and cannot be run on any modern system. However, the language is still studied for its design choices and its influence on modern programming languages.
