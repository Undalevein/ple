# Java Explorations

To build and run Java programs on your local machine, download and install the most recent language version from the [Java downloads page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or use your favorite package manager.

Once installed, programs in this folder can be run from the command line like so:

```
java Triple.java
```

```
java Permutations.java I like carrots
```

```
java TopTenScorers.java < ../test/wnba_input
```

However, several of these example programs are made up of multiple source code files. These examples must be run by explicitly compiling each source code file and then running the main class. For example, to run the AnimalChorusExample program, you must explicitly compile the `.java` file hosting the main program. This will create `.class` files for the main class and any dependent classes. Then, you can run the main class with the `java` command, for example:

```
javac AnimalChorusExample.java && java AnimalChorusExample
```

## About Java

Java is a high-level, object-oriented language created by Sun Microsystems in 1995. Since then, it has taken over as one of the most widely-used languages in Computer Science for its use in a wide range of applications, including desktop, web, and mobile applications, as well as enterprise software systems. Java is propped up by the use of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) which works as an interpreter of sorts which allows for abstraction and the use of its key feature of "write once, run anywhere" capability. Furthermore, it has been praised over the years for its successes in strong memory management, security, and scalability features which allow it to be used in developing large-scale applications, primarily in the realm of big data.
