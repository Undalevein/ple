# About Java

Java is a high-level, object-oriented language created by Sun Microsystems in 1995. Since then, it has taken over as one of the most widely-used languages in Computer Science for its use in a wide range of applications, including desktop, web, and mobile applications, as well as enterprise software systems. Java is propped up by the use of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) which works as an interpreter of sorts which allows for abstraction and the use of its key feature of "write once, run anywhere" capability. Furthermore, it has been praised over the years for its successes in strong memory management, security, and scalability features which allow it to be used in developing large-scale applications, primarily in the realm of big data.
