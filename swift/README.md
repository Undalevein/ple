# Swift Explorations

To run Swift programs on your local machine, download and install the right release for your platform from the [Swift Downloads Page](https://www.swift.org/download/).

Programs in this folder have been tested using Swift 5.7.2 and can be run from the command line like so:

```
swift triple.swift
```

```
swift permutations.swift I like carrots
```

```
swift top_ten_scorers.swift < ../test/wnba_input
```

You can also compile and run separately:

```
swiftc triple.swift && ./triple
```

Running the command `swift repl` gives you a repl.

To run the tests, invoke `./test.sh` in a Unix-friendly shell.

## About Swift

Swift is a general-purpose programming language developed by Apple Inc. for iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS. It was originally designed by Chris Lattner at Apple and first released in 2014. Swift is known for is many safety features, including guaranteed initialization, overflow checking, value types that protect against unwanted sharing, memory management based on automatic reference counting, and a syntax in which dangerous operations look dangerous. The language has excellent support for most modern programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented, and functional programming.
