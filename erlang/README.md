# Erlang Explorations

To begin coding with Erlang either build the language from source or use a prebuilt package. The [Download Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/downloads) page provides step-by-step instructions tailored to your operating system.

After installation, you can compile and execute Erlang programs directly from the command line like so:

```
$ erlc helloworld.erl
$ erl -noshell -s helloworld start -s init stop
```

## About Erlang

Erlang, also known as Erlang/OTP, was created by Joe Armstrong, Robert Virding, and Mike Williams and first introduced to the public in 1986. Originally designed to improve the development of telecommunication systems, it excelled in its purpose at the time but also laid the groundwork for modern programming languages to address contemporary challenges.

With its scalable and functional features, Erlang is well-suited for a variety of applications, including telecoms, banking, e-commerce, computer telephony, and instant messaging.
