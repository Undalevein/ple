# AssemblyScript Explorations

To download AssemblyScript ensure that you are running the [latest version of Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (which includes the package manager `npm`).

Then go into a new directory and enter the following commands into the terminal:

```npm init```

```npm install --save @assemblyscript/loader```

```npm install --save-dev assemblyscript```

The language also provides an easy way to scaffold up an AssemblyScript project by typing the command `npx asinit .`

Once the project has been created, you can write AssemblyScript code in the `index.ts` file.

Lastly, to compile the build you can enter `npm run asbuild` and to run the tests in `test/index.js` you can enter `npm test`.

## About AssemblyScript

AssemblyScript, conceived by Daniel Wirtz and Max Graey in 2017, capitalizes on WebAssembly's capabilities, empowering developers with the option to operate at a low level when necessary. Its syntax bears a striking resemblance to TypeScript, which, in turn, shares syntactic similarities with JavaScript, and it compiles seamlessly to WebAssembly.

The language has gained considerable popularity, as evidenced by the dependency graph within the AssemblyScript repository, which showcases over 25,000 repositories relying on AssemblyScript. Among the standout projects created in AssemblyScript are [wasmBoy](https://wasmboy.app), an emulator for GameBoy, and an open-source [chess game](https://mhonert.github.io/chess/) developed using AssemblyScript in conjunction with React. For more illustrative examples, refer to this comprehensive [compilation of projects](https://www.assemblyscript.org/built-with-assemblyscript.html).
