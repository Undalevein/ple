# Awk Explorations

Awk is usually pre-installed on GNU/Linux systems. To check, type `which awk` in the terminal. If it’s not available, follow the instructions on this [Environment Setup](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/awk/awk_environment.htm) page. 

Once installed, you can run Awk programs from the command line using the following format:

```
awk [options] file ...
```

For a basic usage example, visit this [Basic Syntax](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/awk/awk_basic_syntax.htm) page.

## About Awk

​​Awk was created to scan files and texts, search for patterns, and execute specific actions on the matches. Introduced in 1977, the language was developed by Alfred Aho, Brian Kernighan, and Peter Weinberger, with its name derived from their initials. Even today, Awk remains valuable due to its speed advantage over languages like Python or Ruby. Its interpreter is simpler, making it easier to optimize. Notably, several useful variations have emerged, such as gawk (GNU awk), an enhanced version with additional libraries and a built-in debugger.
