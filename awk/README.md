# Awk Explorations

Awk is usually pre-installed on most Unix-like systems. There are many freely available awk implementations, many with their own language variations and extensions. A popular implementation is `gawk`, which you can obtain through your favorite package manager, or if you are using Windows, the [Gawk for Windows page](https://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gawk.htm).

Programs in this folder have been tested using Gawk 5.3.1 and can be run from the command line like so:

```
awk -f triple.awk
```

To run the tests, invoke `./test.sh` in a Unix-friendly shell or `test.ps1` in PowerShell.

## About

​​Awk was created to scan text files, search for patterns, and execute specific actions on the matches. Introduced in 1977, the language was developed by Alfred Aho, Brian Kernighan, and Peter Weinberger, with its name derived from their initials. Even today, Awk remains valuable due to its speed advantage over languages like Python or Ruby. Its interpreter is simpler, making it easier to optimize. Notably, several useful variations have emerged, such as gawk (GNU awk), an enhanced version with additional libraries and a built-in debugger.
