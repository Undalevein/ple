# About MEL

MEL, short for Maya Embedded Language, is the main language used to create the user interface in Maya. Maya is a 3D modeling program, with high quality rendering and animating capabilities. Because MEL is used to make Maya's interface, everytime a piece of its functionality is accessed, it will run a command in MEL, and the commands run from the user interface can be saved in the script editor to save time when generating code. Code in Maya's script editor can be saved

While Maya's script editor is ideal for small code snippets, a code editor is useful for larger MEL projects.
