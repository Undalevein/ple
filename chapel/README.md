# Chapel Explorations:

To build and run Chapel programs on your local machine, download and install the most recent language version from the [Chapel download page](https://chapel-lang.org/download.html). Or, without installing Chapel locally, try the language online through [GitHub Codespaces](https://chapel-lang.org/tryit-codespaces.html).

Once installed, programs can be run from the command line like so:

```
chpl 01-hello.chpl
./01-hello -nl 1
```

## About Chapel:

Chapel, also known as the Cascade High Productivity Language, is a parallel programming language designed to boost productivity in large-scale systems. Developed by David Callahan, Hans Zima, Brad Chamberlain, and John Plevyak, it first debuted in 2009. Unlike many other languages, Chapel was built from the ground up based on key principles rather than being an extension of a pre-existing language. Its main goals are to support general parallel programming and to significantly improve productivity in parallel programming.
