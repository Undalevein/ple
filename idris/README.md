# Idris Explorations

To start using Idris 2, you can either build it from source or download a pre-built package. The latest version is Idris 2 0.6.0, which you can find on the [Idris Home Page](https://www.idris-lang.org/pages/download.html).

If you use the package manager [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) you can install Idris 2 with:

```
brew install idris2
```

After installation, you can compile and execute Idris programs directly from the command line like so:

```
idris2 hello.idr -o hello
./hello
```

## About Idris

Idris 2 development is being led by Edwin Brady, who also led the development of the original Idris language. Idris was first introduced in 2007, and the 0.7.0 version of Idris 2 was released in 2023. While the two versions share similarities, Idris 2 includes several changes, which you can read about [here](https://idris2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/updates/updates.html#).

Idris 2 is a type-driven development language, with its foundation built on Quantitative Type Theory (QTT). QTT, developed by Bob Atkey and Conor McBride, is a way of keeping track of how often variables are used in a mathematical system called Type Theory. It is used to accurately track resource behaviour in computations.
