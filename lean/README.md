# Lean Explorations

To install the Lean language, follow the directions that apply to your machine on the [Lean installation page](https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html).

Once installed, programs can be run from the command line like so:

```
lean --run Hello.lean
```

## About Lean

Lean, a functional programming language, has been in development since 2013 and was introduced by Leonardo de Moura at Microsoft Research. It was created in order to cater to both general-purpose programming needs and those looking to delve into proof automations. In Lean, the theorem proving aspect comes into play, aiding in the verification of mathematical theorems and ensuring program correctness.

Notably, the language is implemented using a combination of C++ and Lean itself. It's worth mentioning that Lean is currently in active development and is recognized more as a research project than a finalized product.
