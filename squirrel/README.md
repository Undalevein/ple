# Squirrel Explorations:

Due to a bug with the latest version of Squirrel, you will need to install the Squirrel compiler from a branch of Squirrel 3.2 by downloading the zip file from this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/albertodemichelis/squirrel/tree/f92bc298784ceea459b12e2de33bdff672bfeb83). There, unzip it and follow the instructions in the `COMPILE` file that is in the root folder. Afterwards, copy the path to the bin folder (which is where the executable file is located) and add it to to your environment variables.

If you are sturggling to compile the compiler, you can run Squirrel on [TIO](https://tio.run/#squirrel).
