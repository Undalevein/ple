# Perl Explorations

To build and run Perl programs on your local machine, visit the [Perl downloads page](https://www.perl.org/get.html). You'll have an opportunity to update your pre-installed Unix or macOS Perl, or fetch a fresh download for Windows (such as [Strawberry Perl](https://strawberryperl.com)).

Programs in this folder can be run from the command line like so:

```
perl triple.pl
```

```
perl permutations.pl I like carrots
```

```
perl top_ten_scorers.pl < ../test/wnba_input
```

To run the tests on a Unix-like shell:

```
./test.sh

```

## About Perl

Perl was created by Larry Wall, with the original intention being to make report processing easier. The language was inspired by other programming languages such as C and C++. It is widely used because of how well it deals with regular expression and string parsing.
