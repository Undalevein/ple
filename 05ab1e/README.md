# 05ab1e Explorations

The easiest way to program with 05ab1e would be to use this [online interpreter](https://tio.run/#osabie). 

If you want to download the language, you will need to install [Elixir 1.9.0](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html) (or higher) and the package manager Hex by typing `mix local.hex` into your terminal.

Then to update the necessary dependencies use the command `mix deps.get`. Lastly, to compile the project use `MIX_ENV=prod mix escript.build`. On a Windows type `set “MIX_ENV=prod” && mix escript.build`.

To run your code from the terminal you can run this command:

```
escript osabie fileName.abe
```

## About 05ab1e

05ab1e, created by Adnan in 2017, is a stack-based golfing language initially designed to provide an advantage in base conversion. It has since evolved into a general-purpose language. With over 250 built-in commands, programs in 05ab1e are popular within the golfing language community. 

Unlike traditional stack-based languages where stacks comprise integers, 05ab1e's stacks consist of strings. Additionally, it automatically prints the top of the stack if no print command is specified before execution. 

Explore its extensive command list on the language's [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/Adriandmen/05AB1E/wiki/Commands).
