## About Crystal:

Crystal is marketed as a programming language "for humans and computers", emphasizing ease of writing and reading. Its syntax is inspired by Ruby, making it familiar and accessible to many developers. Designed by Ary Borenszweig, Brian Cardiff, and Juan Wajnerman, its first official version was released in 2014.

This general-purpose, object-oriented language has been used in various fields, including networking, cybersecurity, and gaming. A list of [Crystal in Production](https://crystal-lang.org/used_in_prod/) is available on their website.
