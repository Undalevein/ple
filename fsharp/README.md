# F# Explorations

To develop and execute F# programs on your computer, follow these steps:

Visit the [Use F#](https://fsharp.org/use/mac/) page and select the download instructions appropriate for your operating system under the "use" tab.

Alternatively, you can run F# programs directly in your browser by visiting the [Try F#](https://try.fsharp.org/) site.

After installation, you can run F# programs with a `.fs` extension from the command line. For example, to compile and run `hello.fs`, use the following command:

```
dotnet fsi hello.fs
```

## About F#

F# gives everyone the ability to "write succinct, robust, and performant code". Originally designed by Don Syme, F# began as an implementation of OCaml for the .NET framework. Developed by the F# Software Foundation in collaboration with Microsoft, it was first released in 2005.

Primarily, F# is utilized in web development, cloud computing, data science, and application building. The language also draws influence from Python, ML, and OCaml.
