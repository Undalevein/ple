# Nim
- **Creator**: Andreas Rumpf <br/>
- **Released**: 2008 <br/>
- **Unique Features**:
    - Adopts an indentation-based syntax and has multiple language constructs which are inspired by Python
    - **Advanced Language Features**:
      - Incorporates features such as multi-line lambdas, subrange types, distinct types, and safe variants inspired by Ada
      - Also distinguishes between traced and untraced pointers, borrowing from Modula
    - Statically typed, providing the benefits of early error detection. In addition, it supports object-oriented programming principles
    - **Metaprogramming Capabilities**:
      - Leverages metaprogramming with the support of templates and macros
      - Templates declaratively specify code generation, while macros enable compile-time transformations
    - **Cross-Compilation**:
      - The compiler defaults to generating optimized C code
      - Can also emit C++ and Javascript code, causing smooth interaction with APIs written in those languages
    - **Deterministic Memory Management**:
      - Employs a reference counting-based memory management strategy, ensuring deterministic memory handling
      - Allows developers to customize memory management according to their needs
- **Notes**
  - Nim introduces a "stropping" feature that enables the use of any name for a variable, even if it coincides with a keyword. This is achieved using backticks.
  - Nim has gained popularity in the ethical hacking community due to its simplicity and cross-compilation capabilities.
