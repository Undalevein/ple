# Nim Explorations

On macOs, `brew install nim`.

On Unix systems in general, download `choosenim`, an installer for the language:

```
curl https://nim-lang.org/choosenim/init.sh -sSf | sh
```

To install Nim on a Windows machine, download the latest zip file located on the [install Windows page](https://nim-lang.org/install_windows.html).

Once installed, programs can be compiled from the terminal like so:

```
nim c helloworld.nim
```

It can then be run on a Unix system by typing `./helloworld` and for Windows by typing `helloworld.exe`.

## About Nim

Nim, a statically-typed and compiled systems language, began development in 2008. Nim was created by Andreas Rumpf and his team with the purpose of being efficient, expressive, and elegant. In addition, Nim contains many improvements from the languages it has been inspired by. An example of this is how, unlike Python, Nim implements static typing and allows for simple type conversions.

Notably, the language is very popular among the ethical hacking community due to its simplicity and robust cross-compilation capabilities.
