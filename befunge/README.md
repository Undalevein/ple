# Befunge Explorations:

To begin coding with Befunge-93, start by installing the [Befunge93 interpreter](https://github.com/amicloud/befunge93). 

You can also explore other interpreters listed on the [Esolange Interpreters page](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Befunge#Interpreters).

Once you have the interpreter installed, run a Befunge-93 program by calling `run` with your code as the argument. Hereâ€™s an example from the Befunge93 GitHub README:

```
const Befunge = require('befunge93');
let befunge = new Befunge();

befunge.run("1234v\n>9 #5>:#._@\n^876<")
    .then((output) => {
        console.log(output);
    });
```

## About Befunge:

Befunge is an esoteric programming language developed by Chris Pressey which first appeared in 1993 and is "believed to be the first two-dimensional, ASCII-based, general-purpose programming language." It was designed to be as hard to compile as possible and the name of the language Befunge came from accidentally spelling "before" wrong.
