# C Examples

To get C:
<details><summary><b>MacOS</b></summary>
  
Note: Mac automatically has Clang which can be used to compile C programs and files but for this I will show an example using gcc, or the gnu compiler collection: 
  
<br />In your terminal (Mac Terminal): <br />

  ```sh
    $ brew install gcc
  ```  
 </details>
<details><summary><b>Windows</b></summary>
  
<br />In your terminal (Command Prompt or Shell): <br />
  First, install MinGW for Windows and follow the setup procedure. <a href="https://www.scaler.com/topics/c/c-compiler-for-windows/">Look here for more info.</a>

# About C

C is a statically-typed, mid-level lanuage with a prolific history in Computer Programming starting from its creation in 1970 by Dennis Ritchie. Despite its long life, it still remains influential in the Computer Science space for its security features, improved speed compared to other languages, and wide-usage in several areas ranging from operating systems to microcomputers.
