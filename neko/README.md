# Neko Explorations

To get Neko:

<details><summary><b>MacOS</b></summary>
  
<br />In your terminal (Mac Terminal): <br />

```sh
  $ brew install neko --HEAD
```

 </details>
<details><summary><b>Windows</b></summary>
  
<br />In your terminal (PowerShell): <br />

```ps1
  choco install neko
```

</details>

<br/>To run a Neko script, you must first compile the Neko code to make the byte file then run that byte file. To do this, run the following:

```
  nekoc hello_world.neko && neko hello_world.n
```

<br/>To avoid making too much clutter, you can instead compile the Neko code into a bin folder and run the executable files from there.

# About Neko

Neko is a high-level dynamically typed programming language made by Nicolas Cannasse. It was developed as part of the Research and Development effort for better languages at Motion-Twin.

The intent behind making the language is that it was designed to be easy to parse and easy to generate. TODO
