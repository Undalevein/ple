# Whitespace Explorations:
To begin coding with Whitespace, you can use the online esoteric language interpretor to run your

## About Whitespace:

Whitespace is an imperative, stacked-based esoteric language created by Edwin Brady and Chris Morris on April 1, 2003, though it was not meant to be as an April Fool's Joke. It has 3 main characters that are used for syntax: spaces, tabs, and line feeds; any other characters that are not listed are ignored. Obviously, these whitespace characters are impossible to read as they are invisible to the human eye, and it can be really difficult to decipher without helper text. 

Despite being unreadable, Whitespace language supports stack-based language through whitespace combinations. Each command have one or two whitespace characters for I/O, stack manipulation, arithmetic, flow control, and heap access. For making numbers, they start with a sign (\[Space\] is positive and \[Tab\] is negative) followed by the number in binary notation (\[Space\] is 0 and \[Tab\] is 1). Labels are a sequence of \[Space\] and \[Tab\] ended by a \[LineFeed\], which are used for flow control.

## Recommendations for Writing Whitespace
Because the code is completely unreadable, it is recommended that you distinguish using spaces and tabs using characters. Since the characters are ignored, you can use these as comments.

## TODO
* Add alternative way to write whitespace using "s" for spaces and "t" for tabs created by a constructor program.
