# Haxe Explorations:

To begin coding with Haxe, start by installing the [Haxe Compiler](https://haxe.org/download/).

If you are on Windows and want to install Haxe via the command line, type in the following command in Windows Powershell through the Administrator role (you will need to install [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install) if you have not yet done so already):

```
choco install haxe
```

To run a Haxe file like HelloWorld.hx, go to the same directory as the file and then run the following command:

```
haxe --run HelloWorld
```

You can run the tests below on Powershell below using the following command:

```
.\test.ps1
```

Note that the test for "InlineTests.hxml" won't work if you do not have Python installed/working on Powershell. If you don't have Python, comment that line for that test.

## About Haxe:

Haxe is a modern, high-level, object-oriented language. While it was first designed for the Haxe Toolkit, the Haxe Programming Language is also a cross-compiler language, as the programmer can can compiler their code to other existing programming languages such as Java, JavaScript, Python, Neko, ActionScript 3.0, PHP, C++, C#, or Lua. Furthermore, the language itself can be interpreted instead.

Haxe touches on a variety of specializations, including games, web and mobile development, desktop, command-line, and cross-platform APIs.

For more information about the uses of Haxe, you can check out [ways Haxe can be used](https://haxe.org/use-cases/) on the official website.
