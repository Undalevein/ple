# Haxe Explorations:

To begin coding with Haxe, start by installing the [Haxe Compiler](https://haxe.org/download/).

If you are on Windows and want to install Haxe on the command line, type in the following command in Windows Powershell through the Administrator role (you will need to install [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install) if you have not yet done so already):

```
choco install haxe
```

To run a Haxe file like HelloWorld.hx, go to the same directory as the file and then run the following command:

```
haxe --run HelloWorld
```

You can run the tests below on Powershell below using the following command:

```
.\test.ps1
```

Note that the test for "InlineTests.hxml" won't work if you do not have Python installed/working on Powershell. If you don't have Python, comment that line for that test.
