# Haxe Explorations

To build and run Haxe programs on your local machine, download and install the most recent language version from the [Haxe downloads page](https://haxe.org/download/) or use your favorite package manager.

Programs in this folder can be run using Haxe 4.3.4 from the command line like so:

```
haxe --run Triple
```

```
haxe --run Permutations I like carrots
```

```
haxe --run TopTenScorers < ../test/wnba_input
```

Haxe also has command scripts the user can run as well.

```
haxe InlineTests.hxml
```

Note that some of the tests uses Python 3 to show an example for the transpiler.

To run the tests on a Unix-like shell:

```
./test.sh
```

Run `test.ps1` in PowerShell.

## About Haxe

Haxe is a modern, high-level, object-oriented language. While it was first designed for the Haxe Toolkit, the Haxe Programming Language is also a cross-compiler language, allowing the programmer to transpile their code to other existing programming languages such as Java, JavaScript, Python, Neko, ActionScript 3.0, PHP, C++, C#, or Lua. Furthermore, the language itself can be interpreted instead.

Haxe touches on a variety of specializations, including games, web and mobile development, desktop, command-line, and cross-platform APIs.

For more information about the uses of Haxe, you can check out [ways Haxe can be used](https://haxe.org/use-cases/) on the official website.
