# Haxe Explorations:

To begin coding with Haxe, start by installing the [Haxe Compiler](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.3/getting_started/editor/command_line_tutorial.html).

If you are on Windows and want to install Godot on the command line, type in the following command in Windows Powershell through the Administrator role (you will need to install [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install) if you have not yet done so already):

```
choco install haxe
```

To run a Haxe file like HelloWorld.hx, go to the same directory as the file and then run the following command:

```
haxe -main HelloWorld --interp
```

Note that you omit the file extension when running.
