# Clojure Explorations

To build and run Clojure programs on your local machine, download and install the most recent language version from the [Clojure downloads page](https://clojure.org/releases/downloads) or use your favorite package manager.

Programs in this folder can be run from the command line like so:

```
clj -M triple.clj
```

```
clj -M permutations.clj I like carrots
```

```
clj -M top_ten_scorers.clj < ../test/wnba_input
```

Running the command `clj` with no arguments gives you a repl.

To run the tests on a Unix-like shell:

```
./test.sh
```

Run `test.ps1` in PowerShell.

## About Clojure

Clojure is a general-purpose language that is particularly popular for data analysis and machine learning. Clojure is also a popular choice for web development, and is the implementation language for popular web frameworks like Compojure and Luminus.
