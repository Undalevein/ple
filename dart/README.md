## About Dart:

Dart is an easy-to-learn, high-performance programming language created by Lars Bak and Kasper Lund, and developed by Google, with its first release in November 2013. It powers the popular Flutter framework, which is widely used for building cross-platform web, mobile, and desktop applications. Beyond Flutter, Dart excels at core developer tasks such as server-side development, command-line applications, and more, making it a versatile choice for a variety of projects.
