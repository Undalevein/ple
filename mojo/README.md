# Mojo Examples

To get Mojo:
<details><summary><b>Waitlist</b></summary>
  
  Mojo is a very new and widely coveted lanuage. To handle the new traffic, Mojo has a waitlist and is rolling out access quickly. To signup for the wailist visit this <a href="modular.com/get-started">link</a> and fill out the requisite form.
 </details>
<details><summary><b>Playground</b></summary>
  Once off the waitlist, you will be granted access to Mojo through an email. This email will contain various links and information regarding documentation and coding resources, such as FAQ and more. In this email, Mojo will give you access to your own playground inside of JupyterLab that will allow for further experimentation.

# About Mojo

Founded by Chris Lattner, creator of the <a href="https://github.com/rtoal/ple/tree/main/swift">Swift</a> programming language, Mojo was announced fairly recently and was released in a beta format in early 2023. The mojo programming langauge uses the benefits of Python, primarily its dominant reign in aritificial intelligence, but leverages against python a nearly 100x faster experience. Whereas Python is a slow language, this new superset compounds the regular pythonic synatx with new syntax such as type declarations to fairly significantly speed up code. Furthermore, it has been developed primarily for use of GPUs and such hardware to run AI models and software, continuing Python legacy hold on machine learning and similar applications by having somewhat simplistic optimizations to scale to other hardware types. As it is fairly new, the impact of the language will be seen. However, through benchmarks alone, the language definitely appears to outperform it's counterpart and as such will likely become more prevalant in the coming years.

# Mojo Open Source Projects

Studying, and contributing to, open source projects is an excellent way to improve your proficiency in any language. However, before it becomes open-source (ideally in the near future), no major projects will likely come about. if you find some, however, feel free to send a pull request.
