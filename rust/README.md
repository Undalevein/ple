## About Rust:

Rust was created by a software developer named Graydon Hoare as a personal project. Once stable and released, the language was used by larger companies such as Google and Facebook. Rust was also influenced by other programming languages such as C# and C++. It is mainly known for enforcing memory safety and will not compile code if there is an error.
