# Rust Explorations

To build and run Rust programs on your local machine, obtain [rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and use this tool for installation and subsequent updates for the Rust compiler and toolchain.

Once installed, you can run programs in this folder individually with the `cargo run` command. Each have been tested with Rust 1.85.0. Run like so:

```
cargo run --bin triple
```

```
cargo run --bin permutations I like carrots
```

```
cargo run --bin top_ten_scorers < ../test/wnba_input
```

There is no known repl for the language.

To run the tests, invoke `./test.sh` in a Unix-friendly shell or `test.ps1` in PowerShell.

## About

Rust is a multi-paradigm programming language that is mainly used for systems programming. It was started as a personal project by Graydon Hoare in 2006 and developed by Mozilla Research, being first released in 2010. It is known for its garbage-collector-free memory manage system based on ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes, and is consistently ranked the most-loved language on Stack Overflow Developer Surveys.
