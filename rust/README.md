# Rust Explorations

To build and run Rust programs on your local machine, you will first want to get [rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and use this little tool to download and install Rust. Simply follow the instructions on the [installation page](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and youâ€™ll have an installation for your platform and architecture.

Once installed, you can run programs in this folder individually with the `cargo run` command. For example:

```
cargo run --bin triple
```

```
cargo run --bin permutations I like carrots
```

```
cargo run --bin top_ten_scorers < ../test/wnba_input
```

## About Rust

Rust is a multi-paradigm programming language that is mainly used for systems programming. It was started a Mozilla Research in 2006 and was first released in 2010.

Rust was created by Graydon Hoare as a personal project. Once stable and released, the language was used by larger companies such as Google and Facebook. Rust was also influenced by other programming languages such as C# and C++. It is mainly known for enforcing memory safety and will not compile code if there is an error.
