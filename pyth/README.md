# Pyth Explorations

The easiest way to get started with Pyth is to use this [online interpreter](https://pyth-docker.azurewebsites.net).

To run Pyth programs locally, you can clone the github repository by typing `git clone https://github.com/isaacg1/pyth.git` in your terminal.

Then add the following command to your .bashrc, .zshrc, or equivalent:

```
alias pyth="python3 <path to pyth>/pyth.py"
```

Windows users can set up their PATH variable and use `pyth.py`.

## About Pyth

Pyth, developed by Izzy Grosof in 2014, is a golfing language that's heavily influenced by Python. Unlike other golfing languages, Pyth operates with a procedural approach instead of relying on a stack. It can also compile into Python programs. What sets Pyth apart is its simplicity and ability to be concise. For example, all functions, variables, and statements are represented by a single character. Additionally, printing is implicit, and ending quotes are automatically added for you at the end of a program.

The language features excellent documentation at [Read The Docs](https://pyth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
