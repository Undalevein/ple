# Pyth Programming Guide

To run Pyth programs, you have two options: use the online interpreter, or run it locally for more control. For local execution, Python 3 is required. Clone the Pyth repository from GitHub and execute your Pyth code via the command line.

# About Pyth

Pyth is a programming language optimized for code golfing, created by Isaac G. It prioritizes conciseness through single-character commands and implicit operations. Built atop Python, Pyth offers a compact syntax for programming competitions, while still leveraging Python's extensive libraries.
