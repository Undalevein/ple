# Pyth Explorations

The easiest way to program with Pyth would be to use this [online interpreter](https://pyth-docker.azurewebsites.net). 

If you want to download the language, you will need to clone the github repository by typing `git clone https://github.com/isaacg1/pyth.git` in your terminal. 

Then add the following command to your .bashrc:

```
alias pyth="python3 <path to pyth>/pyth.py"
```

Windows users will have to use the PATH and call `pyth.py`.

## About Pyth

Pyth, developed by Izzy Grosof in 2014, is a golfing language that's heavily influenced by Python. Unlike other golfing languages, Pyth operates with a procedural approach instead of relying on stacks. It can also compile into Python programs. What sets Pyth apart is its simplicity and ability to be concise. For example, all functions, variables, and statements are represented by a single character. Additionally, printing is implicit, meaning it will automatically display the top item on the stack.
