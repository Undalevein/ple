# Pascal Explorations

To develop and execute Pascal programs on your computer, start by downloading one of the compilers listed on this [Environment Setup](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/pascal/pascal_environment_setup.htm) page.

Once installed, you can run programs with a `.pas` extension from the command line using the following steps:

Compile your program (`hello.pas` in this example) using the Free Pascal compiler (`fpc`):

```
fpc hello.pas
```

After successful compilation, an executable file named `hello` (along with `hello.o` object file) will be generated. Execute the program by typing:

```
hello
```

## About Pascal

Pascal is a foundational procedural programming language with a wide range of applications, from academic settings to large business systems. Created by Nikolaus Wirth, Pascal was first introduced in 1970.

Over time, various derivatives and enhancements have been developed, the most notable being Object Pascal. Designed to enable object-oriented programming, Object Pascal eventually led to the creation of the Delphi general-purpose programming language.
