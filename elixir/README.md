# Elixir Explorations

The fastest way to start coding with Elixir is by installing it through scripts or your operating system's package manager. The [Installing Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html) page provides step-by-step instructions tailored to your operating system.

After installation, you can execute Elixir programs directly from the command line like so:

```
elixir hello.exs
```

## About Elixir

Elixir is a high-level programming language built on [Erlang](https://github.com/rtoal/ple/tree/main/erlang). Created by José Valim for a research and development project, it was first introduced to the public in 2012. Elixir was designed to leverage Erlang’s functional strengths while enhancing scalability and concurrency.

With its dynamic and functional features, Elixir is ideal for a variety of applications, including web development, embedded systems, machine learning, data pipelines, and multimedia processing. Looking ahead, the [Numerical Elixir](https://github.com/elixir-nx) project aims to bring more enhancements to the language, such as improved machine learning capabilities, interactive notebooks, and more.
