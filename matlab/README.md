# MATLAB Explorations

While MATLAB has many features including computing linear algebra matrices or graphing functions, you unfortunately need to pay for a license to be able to play with the full version of MATLAB. In addition, if you are using home use, you not only have to pay for the program itself, but also pay additional for extra features and amenities.

Luckily, if you want to dip your toes in the water and play around with MATLAB, you can use the limited version of MATLAB online. You can only play around in MATLAB for a maximum of 20 hours/month before you no longer have access until the beginning of next month. If you want to use the free version of MATLAB, go to [MATLAB Online](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab-online/matlab-online-versions.html).

That being said, if you ***really*** want to purchase the product and play with everything this programming language has to offer, you can buy it by visiting the [MATLAB Store Page](https://www.mathworks.com/store/).
