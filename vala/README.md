## About Vala:

Vala is a language influenced by more well-known languages such as C, C++, C#, and Java. It was created by JÅ«rg Billeter and the first version of the language was released in 2006. The language was built because Billeter wanted a high level language to use instead of C to use for GNOME applications.
