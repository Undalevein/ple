# Elm Explorations

To start coding with Elm, follow the system-specific instructions provided on the [Install Elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install/elm) page. This guide also includes steps for minimizing terminal usage while running Elm.

Once installed, you can use [Run-Elm](https://github.com/jfairbank/run-elm) to streamline the execution process in the terminal.

To install Run-Elm:

```
npm install -g run-elm
```

To run your Elm program:

```
run-elm Hello.elm
```

Alternatively, you can write and execute Elm code directly in the [online editor](https://elm-lang.org/examples/buttons).

## About Elm

Elm, created by Evan Czaplicki and introduced in 2012, is a functional programming language that compiles to JavaScript, making it ideal for building websites and web applications. One of Elm's distinct features is its highly detailed and user-friendly error messages which not only detail the cause of errors, but also guide developers on how to fix them and why the solution works.

With its reliability, and JavaScript-like syntax, Elm is an excellent choice for both new and experienced developers looking to create impressive web applications.
