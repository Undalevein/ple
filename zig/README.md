# Zig Explorations

To build and run Zig programs on your local machine, download and install Zig from the [Zig Download](https://ziglang.org/download/) page or use your favorite package manager, e.g. `brew install zig` on macOS.

Once installed, programs in this folder can be run from the command line like so:

```
zig run triple.zig
```

```
zig run permutations.zig -- I like carrots
```

```
zig run top_ten_scorers.zig < ../test/wnba_input
```

Test scripts are provided in this folder for both Bash and PowerShell.

## About Zig

The Zig language was created by Andrew Kelley in 2016, as a pragmatic alternative to the venerable <a href="https://github.com/rtoal/ple/tree/main/c">C</a> programming language. Zig offers many safety features and a growing ecosystem for building and testing. It is known for having “no surprises”: there are no hidden function calls and no hidden memory allocations. Unlike C, Zig has no preprocessor and no macros. Zig does add option types, generics, and custom allocators.
