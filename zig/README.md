## About Zig:

The Zig language was founded by Andrew Kelley in 2016. It was created to replace the <a href="https://github.com/rtoal/ple/tree/main/c">C</a> programming language and be more pragmatic. Zig offers many advancements such as features to improve safety, simple syntax, and a testing framework built into the language. The language also provides strong compile-time guarantees and aims to eliminate common programming errors. While it is a newer language, many developers approve of its capabilities.
