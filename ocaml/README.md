# OCaml Explorations:

To begin coding with OCaml, start by installing the [OCaml compiler](https://ocaml.org/install#linux_mac_bsd), which provides a modern, functional programming language with strong static typing and a robust standard library.

You can also explore OCaml documentation and resources on the [OCaml official website](https://ocaml.org/).

Once you have OCaml installed, you can compile and run your OCaml code using the terminal or command prompt with ease.

## About OCaml:

OCaml is a general-purpose programming language that focuses heavily on expressiveness and safety. The language is a part of the Caml programming language family and was conceived in 1996 by INRIA (French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation). OCaml oddly enough derived from a long line of research into Machine Learning (ML). OCaml features parts of the functional, imperative, and object-oriented programming paradigms; these features make it versatile for a wide variety of applications, from system programming to web development.

OCaml's compiler also features a static type system and its powerful module system supports scalable and maintainable software development.
