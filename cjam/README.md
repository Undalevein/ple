# CJam Explorations

The easiest way to program with CJam would be to use this [online CJam interpreter](https://tio.run/#cjam).

If you want to download the language, make sure Java is installed, and click the download button at the bottom of the [home wiki](https://sourceforge.net/p/cjam/wiki/Home/) page.

Once installed, run this command (where cjam-0.6.5.jar is the latest jar file):

```
java -jar cjam-0.6.5.jar file.cjam
```

## About CJam

CJam, a stack-based programming language, has been in development since 2014. The creator Aditsu wanted to create a language specifically for code golfing, a practice that focuses on space optimization as a competitive sport. It was especially inspired by GolfScript and they both employ single symbols for high-level operations, which optimizes code for space efficiency.

Notably, the language is currently in the “Alpha” stage and is not yet a finalized product.
