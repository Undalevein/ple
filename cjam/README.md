# CJam
- **Creator**: Aditsu <br/>
- **Released**: 2014 <br/>
- **Unique Features**:
    - CJam is a stack-based programming language, eliminating the need for explicit variables in functions and promoting a concise coding style.
    - **Design**:
      - In CJam, a program is typically constructed using literals, operators (often represented by 1 or 2 letters or special characters), variables (identified by a single uppercase letter), and blocks (enclosed within curly braces {}).
      - The language also has built-in functions that facilitate stack manipulation and variable operations.
    - **Code Golfing Focus**:
      - The language lends itself well to code golfing, a practice that focuses on space optimization as a competitive sport.
      - Inspired by GolfScript, CJam employs single symbols for high-level operations, optimizing code for space efficiency.
    - **Differences from GolfScript**:
      - Supports floating-point numbers and character types.
      - Simplified string syntax.
      - Restricts variable assignment to standard variables (uppercase letters).
      - Parses adjacent letters and letters followed by digits separately.
    - **Input Handling**:
      - CJam requires explicit input handling operators ("l," "r," "q") as input is not automatically placed on the stack.
    - **Postfix and Infix Notation**:
      - The majority of the operators use postfix notation, although there are some that use infix notation
      -  The main operators are symbolized with one character, there are others that are symbolized by two falling under the “extended” and “math” categories.
- **Notes**
  - Aditsu plans many updates, including features like duplicate finding, matrix padding, lexicographic array comparison, and backtracking.
