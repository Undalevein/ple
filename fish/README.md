# Fish Explorations:

To begin coding in Fish, you will need to install the shell Fish. Here are some of the options you can do to install

**MacOS/Linux Installation**:

Homebrew:

```sh
brew install fish
```

**Windows**:

In Msys2 Shell, type:

```sh
pacman -S fish
```

After downloading, go to the folder for Msys2 and navigate to usr then bin. There, you should see the `fish.exe` file inside the folder. Then, copy the path and add it to your environmental variables.

Once you have installed fish, you can run the example fish files using the following command:

```
fish hello.fish
```
