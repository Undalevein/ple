# Go Explorations

To build and run Go programs on your local machine, download and install the most recent language version from the [Go downloads page](https://go.dev/doc/install) or use your favorite package manager.

Once installed, programs in this folder can be run from the command line like so:

```
go run triple.go
```

```
go run permutations.go I like carrots
```

```
go run top_ten_scorers.go < ../test/wnba_input
```

While there is no official Go REPL, you can install and run the open source [Gore](https://github.com/x-motemen/gore). Or, write small complete scripts with the [Go Playground](https://play.golang.org/).

To run the tests on a Unix-like shell:

```
./test.sh
```

## About Go

Go is a statically typed, compiled language in the tradition of C. It was created by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson at Google in 2007 and first released in 2009. Go is a general-purpose language that is particularly popular for systems programming. Go is also a popular choice for web development, and is the implementation language for popular web frameworks like Revel and Beego.
