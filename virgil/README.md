## About Virgil

Virgil is a programming language designed for "building lightweight high-performance systems." Its creator, Ben L. Titzer, who is also a co-founder of WebAssembly, is actively developing the project. While Virgil is a simpler programming language, it enables execution for complex tasks and allows for the use of concepts such as interfaces and polymorphism.

Virgil is being used to develop a WebAssembly engine called [Wizard](https://github.com/titzer/wizard-engine), which is also being created by Titzer.
