# Lobster Explorations

Lobster code can be executed using the lobster executable which can be downloaded and set up using the information found [here](https://aardappel.github.io/lobster/getting_started.html).

The recommended method would be using one of the many preset releases on the [github](https://github.com/aardappel/lobster) but it is possible to install by yourself with the installation of some tools such as CMake, C++ desktop tools, the C++ compiler, or a combination of them depending on OS.

## About Lobster

Lobster, developed by Wouter van Oortmerssen, is a language built around the philosophy that the ideal programming language is two programming languages. To accomplish this, lobster marries the simplicity of Python-like syntax with a sophisticated type system and memory management at compile time. The modern, statically typed language implements a fairly terse, lightweight syntax that aims to integrate itself with the heavyweights of game and graphical development. The language emphasizes efficiency and ease of use, catering to developers familiar with C-style languages. Furthermore, the language boasts a complete union with the OpenGL library, a cross-platform graphics API designed for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics. These all combine to make it a promising language for future use in game development and graphics.
