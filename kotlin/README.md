# Kotlin Explorations

To build and run Kotlin programs on your local machine, you can use an IDE such as IDEA or Android Studio, which has a Kotlin environment built-in. You can also use your favorite package manager.

Programs in this folder have been tested using Kotlin 2.0.0 and can be run from the command line like so:

```
kotlinc -script triple.kts
```

```
kotlinc -script permutations.kts I like carrots
```

```
kotlinc -script top_ten_scorers.kts < ../test/wnba_input
```

Running the command `kotlin` with no arguments gives you a repl.

To run the tests, invoke `./test.sh` in a Unix-friendly shell or `test.ps1` in PowerShell.

## About

Kotlin is a statically typed programming language that runs on the Java virtual machine and also can be compiled to JavaScript source code or use the LLVM compiler infrastructure. Kotlin is a general purpose, open source, statically typed “pragmatic” programming language. It is focused on interoperability, safety, clarity, and tooling support. Since 2019, it has been the official preferred language for Android development.
