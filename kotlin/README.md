# Kotlin Explorations

## Kotlin Examples:

To build and run Kotlin programs on your local machine, you’re most likely to be using an IDE, but installing from a package manager such as SDKMAN or brew works quite well.

Once installed, programs in this folder can be run from the command line like so:

```
kotlinc -script triple.kts
```

```
kotlinc -script permutations.kts I like carrots
```

```
kotlinc -script top_ten_scorers.kts < ../test/wnba_input
```

Running the command `kotlin` with no arguments gives you a repl.

To run the tests on a Unix-like shell:

```
./test.sh
```

## About Kotlin

Kotlin is a statically typed programming language that runs on the Java virtual machine and also can be compiled to JavaScript source code or use the LLVM compiler infrastructure. Kotlin is a general purpose, open source, statically typed “pragmatic” programming language. It is focused on interoperability, safety, clarity, and tooling support. Versions of Kotlin targeting JavaScript and native code (using LLVM) are in production as well.
