# Scheme Explorations:

To begin coding with Scheme, start by installing [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/), a popular modern implementation of Scheme that includes a full development environment.

You can also explore other Scheme interpreters and compilers listed on the [Scheme Wikipedia page](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)#Implementations>).

Once you have Racket or another Scheme interpreter installed, you can run Scheme code directly in the REPL or by loading `.scm` files.

Alternatively, feel free to use an [online version](https://tio.run/#scheme-chez) for experimentation before downloading a specific compiler.

## About Scheme:

First developed in the 1975 by Guy L. Steele and Gerald Jay Sussman in MIT's Artificial Intelligence Lab, Scheme is a minimalist and multi-paradigm programming dialect of the Lisp family that empahsizes functional programming, domain-specific languages, and recursive implementation. Scheme boasts an impressive library of implementations that include many fast and portable implementations.

## Scheme Resources:

Continue your study of Scheme via:

- [Racket Language](https://racket-lang.org/)
- [The Scheme Programming Language, 4th Edition](https://www.scheme.com/tspl4/)
- [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html)
- [Scheme on Rosetta Code](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Scheme)

## Scheme Open Source Projects:

Studying and contributing to open-source projects is a great way to build proficiency in any programming language. Racketâ€™s GitHub repository and other Scheme-based projects often include issues that are open for contribution:

- [Racket GitHub Issues](https://github.com/racket/racket/issues)
- [Gambit Scheme GitHub Issues](https://github.com/gambit/gambit/issues)
