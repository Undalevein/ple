# Onyx Explorations

Onyx has a very streamlined process to start coding. The process is os-independent and can be done in a few steps. The following steps will guide you through the process of setting up Onyx on your machine.
The command `sh <(curl https://get.onyxlang.io -sSfL)` will install onyx on your machine. Once this is done, you can run `onyx build -V [filename].onyx`.

Note that you can test out code online by visiting the [Onyx Online Compiler](try.onyxlang.io) without installing the compiler on your machine.

## About Onyx

Onyx is a versatile, modern, and expressive language that combines a familiar, C-like syntax with functional programming capabilities, enabling developers to create a wide range of applications, from machine learning and high-performance web development to immersive games. Onyx prioritizes type safety, rapid development, and exceptional performance through its fast, C-based compiler. Its unique ability to compile to WebAssembly facilitates cross-platform compatibility. The [Onyx Website](https://onyxlang.io/), completed built with the language, is a prime example of the language's capabilities, compiling in just 47.0 ms.
