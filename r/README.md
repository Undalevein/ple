# R Explorations

To build and run Scala programs on your local machine, download and install the most recent language version from the [R project home page](https://www.r-project.org/) or use your favorite package manager.

Programs in this folder can be run from the command line like so:

```
rscript triple.r
```

```
rscript permutations.r I like carrots           # NOT TESTED YET
```

```
rscript top_ten_scorers.r < ../test/wnba_input           # NOT TESTED YET
```

Running the command `r` with no arguments gives you a repl. If you are using Windows, you may need to type `r.exe` instead to access the repl.

To run the tests on a Unix-like shell:

```
./test.sh
```

Run `test.ps1` in PowerShell.
