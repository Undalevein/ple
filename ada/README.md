# About Ada

Ada is a statically-typed, imperative, and object oriented language. The language, conceived around 1980, is favored for its high-level programming aspects, compiler checking rather than runtime errors, increased safety, and mantainability. Primarily developed for embedded systems, the language has since become a focal point for the design and specification of data.
