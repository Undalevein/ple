# Lua Explorations

To build and run Lua programs on your local machine, download and install the most recent language version from the [Lua downloads page](https://www.lua.org/download.html) or use your favorite package manager.

Programs in this folder can be run from the command line like so:

```
lua triple.lua
```

```
lua permutations.lua I like carrots
```

```
lua top_ten_scorers.lua < ../test/wnba_input
```

Running the command `lua` with no arguments gives you a repl.

Tests can be run with `test.sh` or `test.ps1`.

## About Lua

Lua is a lightweight and efficient programming language. It was designed and implemented by a team led by Roberto Ierusalimschy at PUC-Rio, Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio de Janeiro, in Brazil. The first version of Lua was released in 1993 and the language is still being actively developed. Lua is a popular choice for game programming and was the implementation language for titles such as World of Warcraft, Angry Birds, Hades II, Diner Dash, Roblox, and SimCity 4. It interoperates well with other languages, and can easily be embedded into C, C++, Java, Fortran, Smalltalk, and Erlang implementations.
