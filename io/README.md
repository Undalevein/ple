# Io Explorations

If you have a Mac, instead of downloading the binaries, you can run the following command:

```
brew install io
```

To install Io on Windows, go and install the [Io Binaries](https://iolanguage.org/binaries.html) from the official website for the Windows OS.

After downloading and unzipping the folder, activate the executable file inside of the unzipped folder and then store that new file in your system. Then, copy the file location of the bin folder and add it to your Path in the "Environmental Variables."

After setting you, you can run the Io examples using the command below.

```
io .\hello.io
```

You can also run the test files (`test.sh` or `test.ps1`) in your Bash/PowerShell terminals to run/test all of the examples at once.

## About Io

Io is an expressively simple, strong, dynamic, and pure object-oriented programming language made by Steve Dekorte in 2002. As a pure language, it has minimal syntax with all values are object and no keywords. It is dynamic and has built-in concurrency.
