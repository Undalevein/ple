# Io Explorations

To install Io, go and install the [Io Binaries](https://iolanguage.org/binaries.html) from the official website. After installing and unzipping the file, activate the executable file and then store that new file in your system.

If you have a Mac, instead of downloading the binaries, you can run the following command:

```
brew install io
```

If you are on Windows, make sure that you add the location of the bin folder to your Path in your "Environmental Variables."

After setting you, you can run the Io examples using the command below.

```
io .\hello.io
```

You can also run the test files (`test.sh` or `test.ps1`) in your Bash/PowerShell terminals to run/test all of the examples at once.

## About Io

Io is an expressively simple, strong, dynamic, and pure object-oriented programming language made by Steve Dekorte in 2002. As a pure language, it has minimal syntax with all values are object and no keywords. It is dynamic and has built-in concurrency.
